NAME

    String::Substitute - generate strings using different combinations of
    subsitute characters

VERSION

    version 0.006

SYNOPSIS

        use String::Substitute qw(get_all_substitutes);
    
        my @results = get_all_substitutes(
            string => 'ABC',
            substitutions => {
                A => 'Aa',
                B => 'Bb',
            },
        );
    
        say for @results;

    would print (with nondeterministic order):

        ABC
        aBC
        AbC
        abC

    As a one-liner it might look like this:

        perl -Ilib -MString::Substitute=get_all_substitutes -E 'say for get_all_substitutes(string => "ABC", substitutions => { A => "Aa", B => "Bb" })'

DESCRIPTION

    This module is all about generating strings given an initial string and
    a set of allowed character substitutions.

NAME

    String::Substitute - generate strings using different combinations of
    subsitute characters

EXPORTS

 get_all_substitutes

    Return, as a list, all possible strings that can be generated by
    applying different combinations of substitutions to the string passed
    as the 'string' argument. See SYNOPSIS for an example.

    The order in which the different candidates are returned is not
    guaranteed.

    Takes only keyword arguments:

    string

      The string you want to apply the substitutions on.

    substitutions

      A HASHREF mapping each substitutable character to a string of
      different characters that it may be replaced with.

      e.g. {A => "Aa", B => "Bb"} means that each occurrence of A will be
      replaced with an 'A', or an 'a', in the returned substitutions.
