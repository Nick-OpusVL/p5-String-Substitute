NAME

    String::Substitute - generate strings using different combinations of
    subsitute characters

SYNOPSIS

        use String::Substitute qw(get_all_substitutes);
    
        my @results = get_all_substitutes(
            string => 'ABC',
            substitutions => {
                A => 'Aa',
                B => 'Bb',
            },
        );
    
        say for @results;

    would print

        ABC
        aBC
        AbC
        abC

    As a one-liner it might look like this:

        perl -Ilib -MString::Substitute=get_all_substitutes -E 'say for get_all_substitutes(string => "ABC", substitutions => { A => "Aa", B => "Bb" })'

STABILITY

    Experimental, mostly because this depends on Regex::Genex which itself
    admits to relying on experimental or changeable aspects of the Perl
    interpreter.

    Tested on perl 5.20.3 - be sure to run the tests on newer versions if
    you will be relying on this
